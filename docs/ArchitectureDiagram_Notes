🧾 Project Overview
Project Name: DeFi Credit Agent
Hackathon: Agentic Ethereum Hackathon (India)
Team: Glitch

🔍 Problem Statement
Traditional credit systems exclude millions without formal credit history or income proof. This is especially true in underbanked areas where salaried employment or formal records are rare. Access to credit becomes biased, opaque, and centralized — leading to financial exclusion.

💡 Our Solution
DeFi Credit Agent is an AI-powered decentralized credit eligibility system that allows individuals to apply for loans using alternate data and self-sovereign identity.

🧠 AI Model predicts creditworthiness based on financial inputs (income, land ownership, transactions, etc.).

✅ PDF Document Verification (Aadhaar, PAN) for identity validation.

📊 Feature Contribution for transparency.

⛓️ Ethereum Smart Contract is triggered on approval to simulate loan approval on-chain.

💬 Chatbot integrated for assistance.
