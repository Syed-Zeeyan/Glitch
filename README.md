# 🛠 DeFi Credit Agent - Glitch

Welcome to our submission for the *Agentic Ethereum Hackathon* by Reskilll & Geodework! This repository includes our project code, documentation, and related assets.

## 📌 Problem Statement
 
We addressed the challenge of financial inclusion through AI agents. Millions of individuals in India lack access to formal credit due to poor documentation, inconsistent income, or no digital identity linkage. Traditional credit scoring systems exclude these users, limiting their financial opportunities.

## 💡 Our Solution

*Project Name:* DeFi Credit Agent  
We built an intelligent agent-powered credit evaluation system that enables underbanked users in India to get loan eligibility assessed using alternative data (like income, land ownership, digital behavior) through a friendly interface.

🧠 It uses AI to evaluate credit risk.

🔒 Verifies identity via Aadhaar/PAN uploads.

⚖️ Calculates loan eligibility and explains decision factors.

⛓ Pushes approval to a deployed Ethereum smart contract.

Anyone with a mobile phone and digital documents can instantly know if they’re eligible for credit, bridging the gap between DeFi and rural finance.
